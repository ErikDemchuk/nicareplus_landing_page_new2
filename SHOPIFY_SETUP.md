# Shopify Headless Integration Setup

This guide will help you integrate your Next.js landing page with Shopify's Storefront API.

## Prerequisites

1. You have a Shopify store
2. You have installed the Headless channel in your Shopify admin
3. You have generated Storefront API access tokens

## Step 1: Create Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# Shopify Storefront API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store-name.myshopify.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-storefront-access-token
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_PRIVATE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-private-access-token
```

**Important:** Replace `your-store-name` with your actual Shopify store name.

## Step 2: Configure Your Shopify Store

1. Log into your Shopify admin
2. Go to **Apps and sales channels**
3. Find and open the **Headless** channel
4. Create a new storefront or use an existing one
5. Copy your access tokens from the credentials shown in your screenshot

## Step 3: Set Up Products

1. Create your products in Shopify admin
2. Make sure products are published to the Headless sales channel
3. Note the product handles (URLs) for any specific products you want to feature

## Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the pricing section
3. The checkout button should now connect to your Shopify store
4. Test the checkout flow

## Troubleshooting

### Environment Variables Not Working
- Make sure `.env.local` is in your project root
- Restart your development server after adding environment variables
- Check that variable names match exactly (including prefixes)

### API Errors
- Verify your access tokens are correct
- Ensure your store domain is in the format: `store-name.myshopify.com`
- Check that the Headless channel is properly configured

### Products Not Showing
- Verify products are published to the Headless sales channel
- Check product availability and inventory
- Review GraphQL query permissions in your Shopify admin

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Product Display**: Modify the product queries to fetch additional fields like images, descriptions, variants, etc.

2. **Add Cart Functionality**: Implement a persistent cart that users can add multiple items to before checkout.

3. **Implement Customer Accounts**: Add customer login/registration using Shopify's Customer Account API.

4. **Add Inventory Management**: Display real-time inventory levels and handle out-of-stock scenarios.

5. **Optimize Performance**: Implement caching strategies for product data and consider using Shopify's CDN for images.
